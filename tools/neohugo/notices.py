"""Writes the third-party licence notices for a release build of neohugo-rs (Python stdlib only).

Usage:
  notices.py <target> <out-file>

The notices cover every package linked into `neohugo-rs` for <target>: the normal-dependency
closure of the `neohugo` package in `cargo metadata --filter-platform <target>`. Build and dev
dependencies are not linked into the binary, and neither are proc-macro packages (they run in
the compiler), so the walk does not enter them. For each package the file lists its name,
version, licence expression, authors and where its source is, followed by the licence and notice
files the package ships: files in the package root named LICENSE*, LICENCE*, COPYING*, NOTICE*,
COPYRIGHT*, UNLICENSE*, AUTHORS* or PATENTS*, and for packages that build C code (`links`, or a
`-sys` name) the same files anywhere below the package, which covers vendored C libraries such
as libwebp. A text already printed for an earlier package is referenced instead of repeated.

A package that ships no licence file but is licensed under MIT (alone or as one choice) gets the
MIT licence text with the authors from its Cargo.toml. Any other package without a licence file
is printed and the script exits with status 1 unless --allow-missing is given, so a new
dependency like that is noticed. Workspace members are covered by the repository's LICENSE.

package.py puts the result into the release archives as THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt
(.github/workflows/rust.yml, rust/README.md "CI and releases").

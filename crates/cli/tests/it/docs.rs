//! Gates A-D2 and A-D3 (docs-live, [`gate_a_d3`]): the legacy docs site, the test fixture
//! `testdata/legacy-docs`. fugo's own documentation, `docs/`, is checked by [`crate::docs_site`].
//!
//! Gate A-D2 (REWRITE_PLAN.md §7.3, T66): the legacy docs site with the `reduced` docs
//! patches, built by the binary against the committed golden data of the Go build
//! (`testdata/golden/docs-reduced/`) through the acceptance harness:
//! `tools/dev/compare.sh docs-reduced --ref golden` (`sites.py make docs-reduced --overlay
//! sites/docs`, both passes, `structdiff.py` and the ratchet of
//! `testdata/baselines/docs-reduced.json`).
//!
//! The reduced variant keeps Chroma highlighting (with `hl` inline/`noClasses` and
//! `shortcodes/highlight.md`), GoAT diagrams (`diagrams_goat`), emoji, passthrough with
//! `to_math`, `remarshal` in `code-toggle`, Tailwind through `defer` and the real Alpine/Turbo
//! `js_build`. The gate: L1 889/889 in both passes (888 in `public` plus `build_stats.json`),
//! the structure oracle and L2 on every file, L4 on every asset, every page's visible text (A7
//! 1.0; the one L3 difference is the Go build's stats file, Go's tokenizer reading `<?xml` and
//! `<=` as tags) and a clean ratchet.
//!
//! Tailwind and `js_build` need the node tools; without them the test prints
//! `SKIPPED` and passes ([`crate::acceptance`]). The Go binaries are not needed. The binary
//! must have the default features `goat` and `math`.

//! Runs rolldown's async builds for synchronous callers.
//!
//! A build is a task on a process-wide tokio runtime; the caller blocks on a channel until it
//! is done. The caller must not do anything else while it waits: neohugo realizes a resource
//! under that resource's lock, and a waiting thread that ran other work (such as
//! `rayon::yield_now`) could take the same lock again and deadlock.
//!
//! rolldown parallelizes on the global rayon pool and waits for it inside a build. A caller on
//! a global-pool worker therefore takes a thread the build may need; neohugo calls from its own
//! render pool, never from the global one.

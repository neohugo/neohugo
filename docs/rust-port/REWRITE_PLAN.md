# neohugo Rust rewrite plan

**Status.** Final plan, revision 2, dated 2026-09-29. This revision applies the completeness, feasibility and Rust-style reviews. Review points that were rejected, or only partly applied, are listed in §12 "Review notes".

**What it replaces.**
- `crates/TERA_PLAN.md`. T00 moved that file to `docs/rust-port/` with a pointer to this plan (T70 archived it: `docs/rust-port/archive/TERA_PLAN.md`).
- The byte-parity rules in `crates/README.md`.
- `docs/rust-port/HANDOFF.md` §4 (T70 rewrote the handoff; the old one is `docs/rust-port/archive/HANDOFF-old-port.md`).

**Repo.** `/home/user/neohugo`, branch `rust-port`.

**Facts checked while writing this plan.**
- **Disk.** 4.5 GB free. `crates/` takes 423 MB, `~/go/pkg/mod` takes 2.2 GB. The working tree without `crates/` and `.git` is 55 MB.
- **Docs layouts.** `docs/layouts` has 76 files and 3,372 lines. `docs/layouts/_shortcodes/quick-reference.html` prints `.Content` of other pages.
- **Version.** The fork is `0.149.0-DEV` (`common/neohugo/version_current.go`).
- **Seeksnack reconstruction.** It has `_default/_markup/render-table.json.json`, and its home, list, term and 404 layouts call `.Paginator`.
- **Tera 2.4.0 behaviour:**
  - A list comprehension accepts a single `if` clause (`parser.rs` `parse_list_comprehension`).
  - `starting_with` and `ending_with` take `pat=` (`tests.rs:147-158`).
  - The `fast` feature equals `no_fmt` + `fast_escape` + `fast_hash`.
  - A component renders with a fresh `State`. It sees only its arguments, plus `@implicit` values looked up through the caller chain (`vm/interpreter.rs:965-1000`, `vm/state.rs:113-160`).
  - A site function's `State::get` never reaches the caller of a component.
- **Toolchain.** rustc and cargo 1.94.1.
- **I01 patches.** `tools/rust-port/i01/sites.py` `DOCS_REMOVE` / `DOCS_REPLACE` / `DOCS_WRITE` (lines 88-150) patch layouts as well as content and config. The patches include `codeFences = false`, Tailwind → `minify`, QR/Text → Resize/Grayscale, and the Chroma → `printf` replacements.

## 1. Summary and decision

### 1.1 Decision record

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Approach | A new Cargo workspace `rust/` with 22 product crates, a dev-only `testkit`, and an internal `workspace-hack`. Hugo's site and page model is rewritten in idiomatic Rust. We do not fork Zola, and we do not refactor the old crates in place. |
| Old port | T00 tags the current byte-identical state as `go-parity-final`. It converts the engine-neutral fixtures to plain JSON, moves them to `rust/testdata/`, and deletes `crates/` completely, ignored `target/` directories included. Later tasks read salvage material with `git show go-parity-final:crates/...`. |
| Oracle | The Go build of the same `sites.py` inputs is the structural oracle. It gives the same files, URLs, aliases, feeds, chosen templates and resource URLs. Output bytes no longer have to match. |
| Templates | `tera = "=2.4.0"` with features `no_fmt`, `fast_hash`, `preserve_order`; `fast_escape` is not used. <ul><li>Layouts, and assets processed with `execute_as_template`, are hand-converted into `rust/sites/<site>/`.</li><li>The engine accepts **only Hugo v0.146 (new-style) layout names**.</li><li>Content files keep Hugo's shortcode syntax and never go through Tera.</li><li>i18n files keep Hugo's `{{ .Field }}` placeholders, read by a restricted evaluator (not a template engine).</li></ul> |
| Template API | Tera-native: operators, list comprehensions with `if`, `~`, map and array literals, components. There is no Go `printf`, `where` or `Scratch` clone. The single source of truth is the Rust table `neohugo_funcs::spec::FUNCS`. `rust/docs/template-api.md` is generated from it and snapshot-checked. |
| Markdown | comrak 0.55 behind an engine-neutral `neohugo-markup` API. The T04 spike runs it over all 959 docs files and all 251 seeksnack bodies before the API is frozen. pulldown-cmark is the fallback behind the same API. |
| Highlighting | syntect 5.3 + two-face, emitting Chroma class names (and inline styles for `noClasses`). Not giallo, which is EUPL-1.2 (D1). |
| Data model | An arena of `Page` values in `IdVec<PageId, Page>`, with one `BTreeMap<ContentKey, PageId>` tree per language. URLs are computed after cascade. Every path flavour is a newtype. Data files and nested values use a case-preserving `Map`; front matter, config and language params use the case-folded `Params`. |
| Views | Values are pre-serialised once and shared through `Arc` as `tera::Value`. Relation lists hold **summary** values; `deref` and `get_page` return full values. There is a Meta generation (content phase) and one Full generation per hook variant. All generations are frozen in `OnceLock`s before any layout renders. |
| Render scope | Every render (layout job, shortcode, hook, `partial()`, `render_string`, `defer`, `execute_as_template`) carries an explicit scope value `__nh` in its Tera context: page, language, format, pager, phase, variant, frame, transaction, depth and call chain. There are **no thread-locals**. |
| Content | All content is rendered before layouts. Memo cells never block. A cycle is detected through the call chain in the scope. Fragments form their own memo stage. Page-store writes made during content rendering are buffered and committed only by the computation that wins its memo cell. |
| Pagination | `paginator()` and `paginate()` record the first call per (page, format). An identical re-call reuses the recording. A re-call with a different list or size is an error that names both template positions. |
| Publishing | Bundle resources are published eagerly. Every other resource is published when its URL appears in a rendered template output, matched after decoding HTML and JSON escapes, or when the `publish` filter is applied. There is no scan of plain CSS or JS. |
| Verification | <ul><li>A walking skeleton in round 7.</li><li>A Go **structure oracle**: per (page, format) the template and baseof, targets, permalinks and resource URLs.</li><li>A stdlib-only Python `structdiff` with levels L1–L4, a minified and an unminified pass, and a ratchet baseline with triage classes.</li><li>Two docs patch variants, mirrored 1:1 in Go and Tera.</li></ul> |
| Agent isolation | One git worktree per agent. All worktrees share `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=rust/target`. Only green commits are merged. |
| Licence | neohugo stays Apache-2.0. The policy lives in `rust/deny.toml` (cargo-deny format) and is evaluated as SPDX expressions by `tools/neohugo/licence-check.sh`. No EUPL, GPL or AGPL. Zola 0.22 and later is a design reference only (D2). |

### 1.2 What "Rust style" means here (binding for every task and review)

**Typed domain model**
- Use enums instead of bundles of bools: `UglyPolicy`, `Escaping`, `PageRole`, `Markup`, `BlockquoteKind`, `Alignment`, `InnerUse`, and so on.
- Every path flavour is a newtype with exactly one constructor: `ContentKey`, `TermKey`, `OutputPath`, `UrlPath`, `Permalink`.
- Typed ids index `IdVec<I, T>`. There is never a `.0 as usize`.
- Only user params, data files and markup attributes are untyped (`Value`).
- The clippy pedantic subset includes `struct_excessive_bools` and `fn_params_excessive_bools`.

**Ownership and state**
- The `Model` is built once, then shared read-only through `Arc`.
- Mutable build state lives only in named concurrent collections owned by the render `Session`:
  - content memo cells;
  - page stores;
  - the pagination recorder;
  - the deferred registry;
  - partial frames;
  - the resource registry;
  - the image queue.
- There are no global mutable statics and **no thread-locals**. `rust/clippy.toml` sets `disallowed-macros = ["std::thread_local"]`.
- The render position travels as an explicit scope value.

**Services**
- Each Tera function is a small struct that holds only the `Arc`s it needs, for example `GetPage { model, views }` or `I18n { translations }`.
- Only content-dependent functions hold a `Weak<dyn ContentRenderer>`. That trait has 5 methods.
- There is no service locator.

**Errors**
- Every library crate uses `thiserror` enums, including `neohugo-build` (`BuildError`). `anyhow` is used only in `cli`.
- Site functions wrap causes with `tera::Error::chain`.
- Diagnostics carry a `Position`. They are aggregated, de-duplicated and sorted before they are reported.
- We never reproduce Go error texts.

**Determinism**
- Determinism comes from sorted collections and explicit tie-breaks.
- We never emulate Go map order, sort instability or worker-count effects.
- We never reproduce Hugo quirks that come only from Go implementation details: `sync.Once` pagination, character-level radix prefixes, `$_hugo_config` v1, printf verbs.

**Config**
- One `Value`-tree pipeline (normalise → migrate legacy keys → merge once → per-language merge), then typed serde structs with `Default`.
- No mapstructure-style decoders.

**Parallelism**
- rayon over natural units: files, pages, jobs, image ops. No async in the build path.
- A render never starts parallel work. This is checked with a debug assertion on `render_pool.current_thread_index()`.

**Crate hygiene**
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- Small public APIs with rustdoc.
- Heavy dependencies isolated in leaf crates.
- `cargo fmt` everywhere; clippy (`all` + the reviewed pedantic subset) once per phase.

**Go is reference only.** Go files, the old port, `docs/rust-port/specs/*.md` and the oracles are read for rules and test cases. Every task review checks:
1. no Go-order emulation;
2. no `interface{}`-style or stringly-typed plumbing;
3. no Go method tables;
4. no byte-level Go state machines transliterated;
5. no Zola-isms (Section/Page split, URLs computed at parse time, `@/` links, orphan pages).

### 1.3 Why this base, and what was grafted

**Why not the alternatives.**
- **zola-derived was not chosen.**
  - Only about 15% of its lines come from the MIT fork point, and that is Tera 1 without the modern Zola pipeline.
  - It chose pulldown-cmark to stay close to the fork, not because it fit.
  - It missed the cross-page `.Content` and per-format hook needs.
  - Its lazy cells block, which can deadlock under rayon.
- **incremental-refactor was not chosen.**
  - It carries two template engines and `go_value` shims.
  - After wave 5 it becomes a long serial tail, and its disk use peaks while old and new code coexist.
  - Its verification ideas were adopted instead.

**Grafts.**

| Graft | Source | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Tag `go-parity-final`, delete legacy code, salvage through `git show` | zola-derived | §6, T00 |
| Go `structure` oracle | zola-derived | T01; gates in T23b, T30, T60–T66 |
| Summary relation lists, `deref`, Meta/Full generations | zola-derived | §2.5, T33 |
| structdiff L1–L4, allowlists, staged docs gates | zola-derived | §7 |
| `_embedded/` and `_theme<N>/` fallback prefixes | zola-derived | §4.1 |
| `Hooks` trait with default methods | zola-derived | §2.4 |
| Licence check, `PROVENANCE.md` | zola-derived | §5, T00 |
| Ratchet with triage classes, harness self-test, unminified pass | incremental-refactor | §7.2, T03 |
| comrak spike in round 2 | incremental-refactor | T04 |
| `templates check` | incremental-refactor | §4.8, T37 |
| Walking skeleton | incremental-refactor | T38 |
| Pagination recorded at call time | incremental-refactor | §3.3 |
| Explicit render scope, frames by id, chain-based cycle detection | Rust-style review | §2.5, §4.2 |
| Case-preserving `Map` vs folded `Params` | completeness and feasibility reviews | §2.4 |
| Docs patch variants 1:1 with Go | completeness and feasibility reviews | §7.4 |

### 1.4 Accepted weaknesses

1. **Hugo semantics are re-derived**: cascade, sanitising, taxonomy keys, layout scoring, pagination. Mitigation: salvage from `go-parity-final`, with oracle fixtures from day one.
2. **The first real full build comes in round 10.** The walking skeleton (round 7) and the structure-oracle gates (T23b, T30) give earlier signals.
3. **Existing Hugo sites do not run unchanged.** Every layout, and every asset used as a template, must be converted to Tera (D4). That is about 5k Tera lines for the three sites, plus about 1.2k lines of embedded templates.
4. **Acceptance is structural, not `cmp`.** It is backed by the ratchet and hard invariants (§7).
5. **Some Hugo idioms become explicit calls.**
   - Another page's `.Content` inside a shortcode becomes `page_content(page=…)`.
   - Inside a component, site-bound functions need `page=` or the implicit `@__nh` parameter.
   - A second, conflicting `.Paginate` becomes an error.

The binary stays `neohugo-rs`, so the harness scripts keep their names.

### 2.2 Cargo configuration (driven by the disk budget, §8.1)

```toml
# rust/Cargo.toml (excerpt)
[workspace]
resolver = "3"
members = ["crates/*"]

[workspace.package]
edition = "2024"
license = "Apache-2.0"
rust-version = "1.94"          # local rustc 1.94.1; resolver 3 picks MSRV-compatible versions

[profile.dev]
debug = "line-tables-only"
incremental = false            # incremental caches are the largest consumer of target/

[profile.dev.package."*"]
debug = false
opt-level = 1

[profile.dev.package.image]
opt-level = 3
[profile.dev.package.fast_image_resize]
opt-level = 3
[profile.dev.package.zune-jpeg]
opt-level = 3
[profile.dev.package.libwebp-sys]        # the C build reads this crate's opt-level, not webp's
opt-level = 3
[profile.dev.package.syntect]
opt-level = 3
[profile.dev.package.fancy-regex]
opt-level = 3
[profile.dev.package.grass]
opt-level = 3
```

**Member crate rules.**
- `[lib] doctest = false`.
- `autotests = false` with a single `[[test]] name = "it" path = "tests/it/main.rs"`.
- `view`, `sitefuncs`, `render`, `build` and `cli` also set `[lib] test = false`. Their tests live only in `tests/it`, so they have one test binary each; each of these binaries links the heavy graph.
- No third-party `features =` in member manifests.
- Every member depends on `neohugo-workspace-hack`.

**Feature unification.** Cargo unifies features per invocation, over the selected packages only. So `-p a` and `-p b` would otherwise build light shared dependencies (serde, regex, memchr, indexmap, hashbrown, smallvec, …) with different feature sets, giving duplicate artifacts.
- T00 writes `crates/workspace-hack` by hand. It depends on those light shared dependencies with the union of their features, checked with `cargo tree -e features -i <dep>`.
- Heavy crates never go into the hack.
- If cargo 1.94.1 has a stable `resolver.feature-unification = "workspace"` (T00 verifies), T00 uses it instead and drops the hack.

**Platform.** `cargo fetch` and `cargo metadata` always run with `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` / `--filter-platform x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. T00 commits `Cargo.lock`.

### 2.3 Crate dependency graph

Arrows point to dependencies. Every crate also depends on `base`.

```
base  (ids, PageKind, KindSet, Value/Map/Params, path newtypes, diag, Sink)
config      ── base
vfs         ── config
pageparser  ── base            locale ── base          esbuild ── base
minify*     ── config          images* ── config       highlight* ── config, markup(trait only)
page        ── config, vfs
site        ── page, pageparser, vfs, locale
nav         ── site
markup      ── config                         (defines Highlighter + Hooks traits)
layouts     ── config, vfs, tera
funcs       ── locale, tera, tera-contrib
resources   ── vfs, images, minify, esbuild, tera
view        ── site, nav, resources, markup, layouts(TemplateName), tera
sitefuncs   ── view, funcs, resources, locale
render      ── view, sitefuncs, layouts, funcs, markup, pageparser
publish     ── config, minify
build       ── render, publish, resources, images, highlight, esbuild
cli ── build, serve        serve ── build (+ its config, vfs, site, publish)        testkit (dev) ── base, funcs(spec), tera
```

- **Shared types live in `base`.** `PageKind`, `KindSet`, the ids and `trait Sink` are defined there. Neither `config` nor `layouts` depends on `page`.
- **URL tokens.** `ResourceStore` never depends on `publish`: `publish` produces plain `UrlTokens`, and `build` passes them to the store.
- **Images.** `view` reaches images only through `ResourceStore`.
- **Heavy crates** (marked `*`) never compile in the core lane (base → config → vfs → page → site → nav).
- **T00 proves the graph is acyclic** by writing stub crates with their real dependency edges and running `cargo metadata`.

### 2.4 Core types

The signatures below are illustrative. Names, ownership and crate boundaries are binding; field sets may still grow.

```rust
// ───────────── neohugo-base ─────────────
pub mod id {
    pub trait Idx: Copy + Ord + std::hash::Hash { fn index(self) -> usize; fn from_index(i: usize) -> Self; }

### 2.5 Views and render state (neohugo-view)

**Serialisation.** Views derive `Serialize` and are converted once with `tera::Value::from_serializable`. Nested `tera::Value` fields pass through as `Arc` clones.

**Every documented key is always present**, with `none` for absent values, because Tera 2 raises an error when an undefined value is printed. A test renders a template that prints every documented key, for every kind.

```rust

## 3. Build data flow

### 3.1 Phases

| # | Phase | Crate | Input → output | Parallelism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Config** | config | See the pipeline below | sequential |
| A2 | **Mounts** | vfs | Config → `Vfs`. Default mounts only for unconfigured components; `lang` on mounts; themes after the project, in `Config::themes` order (each theme's configured mounts, else its component directories). | sequential |
| A3 | **Discover** | vfs | Walk content mounts → `FileRef` + `PathInfo`. Ignore rules apply; files in a disabled language are dropped. | `par_iter` over mounts |
| A4 | **Parse** | pageparser, page, site, locale | Read, split and decode front matter → folded `Params` + body `Arc<str>`. `data::load` → case-preserved `Map`. `Translations::load` → messages parsed into pieces. | **`par_iter` over files** |
| B1 | **Assemble tree** | site | Apply `capture_overrides` (kind, lang, path) **before** insertion. Insert into the per-language `SiteTree` in key order. Bundle ownership is the segment-aware longest-prefix owner. A duplicate (Base, lang) keeps the first and warns. Bundled content files get `PageRole::BundledResource`. Bundle resources are registered once per bundle directory with the owning language. | sequential per language, languages in parallel |
| B2 | **Cascade → meta → dates → filter** | site, page | Tree-order walk: inherited cascade (own front matter wins), `meta_from_params`, `DateResolver` (language time zone), build policy (`headless` folded in), drafts/future/expired against `--clock`. A deleted page takes its subtree with it. | walk sequential; per-page decode parallel |
| B3 | **Auto nodes** | site | Root sections; taxonomy pages, even with no terms; term pages; home; standalone pages (404 and sitemap per site, sitemapindex and robots once). | sequential |
| B4 | **URLs** | page, site | kind, type, section, format → `TargetPaths` + `Links`, **after** cascade | **`par_iter` over pages** |
| B5 | **Lists and relations** | site | Default-sorted pages, regular pages and sections; next/prev; translations (sharing `ResourceId`s); node dates (max); taxonomies and weights | sorts `par_iter` over nodes |
| B6 | **Navigation** | nav | `Menus` (pageRef resolved), `RelatedIndex`, `Vec<AliasPlan>` | small |
| B7 | **Templates** | layouts | `LayoutStore::scan` (v0.146 names only); selection for every (page, format) and standalone page; baseof variants; `Session::new` loads Tera once, validating all names | selection `par_iter` |
| C0 | **Meta views** | view | Model → Meta generation (summaries without content; full values lazy) | `par_iter` |
| C1 | **Content** | render | For each page with a body, bundled content resources included, and each hook variant: (a) lex, assemble, execute shortcodes → `ExpandedSource` (page-local placeholders, context spans); (b) fragments, parse-only; (c) render: comrak for `Markup::Markdown`, pass-through for `Markup::Html`, hooks with `page_inner`, `CodeFences`; (d) swap placeholders; summary, plain text, word counts, TOC | **`par_iter` over pages**; memo cells for cross-page access |
| D | **Full views** | view | Build one Full generation per hook variant and freeze them in the `OnceLock`, all **before** E2 | `par_iter` |
| E1 | **Static copy** | publish | Static mounts → sink. Runs first, so rendered outputs win conflicts. | `par_iter` |
| E2 | **Wave 1** | build, render, publish | **One sub-wave per language, in language order.** Each sub-wave renders aliases, then pages × formats (pager 1), then standalone pages. Pagination calls are recorded. Every output goes through `Publisher::emit`. | `jobs.par_iter()` within a sub-wave |
| E3 | **Wave 2** | build | Pagers 2..N from the recorder, `page/1/` aliases (HTML formats only), language redirect | `par_iter` |
| E4 | **Stats** | publish, resources | Merge per-thread sets → `hugo_stats.json`, sorted, honouring `disableIDs`. Write it to the project root (as Hugo does; external tools read it from disk) and `inject_generated` it for its mounted asset path. | reduce |
| E5 | **Deferred wave** | build, resources | Render each `defer(...)` template once per key (docs: Tailwind). Realise `post_process` fields (seeksnack PostCSS purge reads the stats). This gives a replacement map → `patch_held`, which re-extracts URL tokens, then minify and write. | `par_iter` over deferred keys |
| E6 | **Publish resources and images** | resources, images | Eager bundle resources, plus every resource whose URL is in `UrlTokens`, plus explicit `publish`. Only referenced image ops are processed, into `[caches.images]`, then copied. No scan of plain CSS/JS text. | **`par_iter`** (outside any render) |
| E7 | **Report** | build, cli | Sorted, de-duplicated diagnostics; errors fail the build | – |

**A1 config pipeline** (rust-style; there is no mapstructure port):
1. **Bootstrap.** Read `environment`, `source` and `configDir` from `CliOverrides` and `HUGO_*`.
2. **Load sources into `Value` trees:**
   - the project's config file: the first that exists of `neohugo.{toml,yaml,yml,json}`, then Hugo's `hugo.*` and `config.*` (compatibility with Hugo sites); when several exist, a warning names the file read and the ones ignored. `--config a,b` lists the files explicitly;
   - `config/_default/**`, then `config/<env>/**`, with the file-name → key rules of semantics §1.2 (`neohugo.*`, `hugo.*` and `config.*` there are root files).
3. **Normalise every tree.**
   - `normalize_keys`: lower-case keys except inside arrays; `menu`→`menus`; drop `internal`.
   - `migrate_legacy_keys`:
     - `indexes`→`taxonomies`
     - `paginate`→`pagination.pagerSize`
     - `paginatePath`→`pagination.path`
     - `rssLimit`→`services.rss.limit`
     - `pygments*`→`markup.highlight.*`
     - `writeStats`→`build.buildStats.enable`
     - `footnoteReturnLinkContents`→`markup.goldmark.extensions.footnote.backlinkHTML`
     - `ignoreErrors`→`ignoreLogs`
     - bool `minify`→`minify.minifyOutput`
4. **Deep-merge once**, in this precedence: defaults < file < dir < CLI < env.
   - Env is applied once. Each value is parsed into the variant of the value it overrides.
   - `disableKinds` and `disableLanguages` are split on commas and whitespace.
   - **Themes** below the project (Hugo's module collection and `_merge` semantics; `neohugo-config` README "Themes"):
     - found in import order, depth first: `[[module.imports]]`, then `theme = [...]`, then each theme's own imports after it (`theme = ["a", "b"]` with `a` importing `c`: a, c, b; the first wins); in `themesDir`, `_vendor` (`modules.txt`) or at an absolute path; `module.replacements`, `ignoreConfig`, `ignoreImports`, `noMounts`, `disable`; Hugo Modules are not downloaded;
     - each theme's config: the first of `neohugo.*`, `hugo.*`, `config.*` in its directory, then its `config/_default/**` and `config/<env>/**`;
     - merged theme by theme: the project's values win; a theme adds only keys the project lacks, as the `_merge` strategy of the project's table allows (`params` deep, `menus`/`outputFormats`/`mediaTypes` shallow, other root keys none unless the root sets `_merge`; `languages.X.params` deep, `languages.X.menus` shallow; inherited below); root values that are not tables only with a `deep` root; a theme's `theme`, `module` and `themesDir` are never merged.
     - Deliberate deviations: no Hugo Modules download (a theme that is not found is always an error); a theme's `theme`/`module`/`themesDir`/bootstrap keys never merge (Go merges them under a `deep` root after using the project's); `_merge` values ignore case; a project non-table value where a theme has a table is kept (Go panics).
5. **Per-language merge.** For each enabled language, merge `languages.X` over the root tree.
6. **Typed deserialise.** serde into structs with `#[serde(default)]` and `impl Default` holding Hugo's defaults. `[frontmatter]` chains become `Vec<DateSource>` and `outputs` become `Vec<FormatId>`. Errors carry toml/saphyr spans.

### 3.2 Content phase

**Shortcodes run before markdown.**
- The lexer runs over the whole body, including code fences. That is why the docs site writes `{{</* */>}}`.
- `{{% %}}` output is spliced into the markdown source.
- `{{< >}}` output becomes a page-local ASCII token `NHSC<n-hex>X`, stored in the page's `ExpandedSource.placeholders`. It is swapped in after markdown, and a `<p>TOKEN</p>` wrapper is removed.

**`render_shortcodes(page=q)` inside `{{% include %}}`** returns q's `ExpandedSource`. The including page does three things:
- appends q's placeholders to its own table and renumbers the tokens in the spliced text;
- shifts q's context spans;
- adds a span `(range, q)` for the spliced text.

Markdown hooks inside that range receive `inner_page = q` (Hugo `.PageInner`). That is how the docs link hook resolves relative links and resources in `_common/*` snippets. The spans are computed from comrak `sourcepos`; T04 verifies accuracy for inline nodes. No textual markers ever reach the markdown, so `unsafe=false` raw-HTML omission is not affected.

**Inner content.**
- `InnerUse` is known statically from `Templates::uses_variable(tpl, "inner" | "inner_deindent")`, following includes and parents.
- The inner of the outermost `{{% %}}` is raw.
- A nested `{{% %}}` has its inner rendered as markdown. A single line loses its `<p>`.
- `$_hugo_config` v1 semantics are **not** reproduced (D5).
- `ordinal` counts per nesting level; `parent` is the enclosing call.

**Fragments are their own memo stage.** The docs link hook validates anchors in other pages, so A links to B and B links to A. The fragments stage parses the expanded source and never runs hooks.

**Code fences.**
- With `CodeFences::Plain` (the testsite, and docs under the I01 patches), fences render as `<pre><code class="language-x">` with no hook and no highlighter.
- With `Hooked`, the user or embedded code-block hook (including goat) runs. A fence with no hook goes to the `Highlighter`.

**HTML content** (`Markup::Html`, for example R `blog/html-page.html`) skips comrak. Shortcodes, the summary divider and the auto summary still apply.

**Hooks and the page store.** Hooks write the page store during C1 (docs `hasMath`, `hasToc`). The writes are buffered per `TxnId` and committed by the winning computation, so the store is complete before layouts run. The docs `{{ $noop := .WordCount }}` trick is deleted during conversion.

**Per-format content variants.** A page's content is rendered for every `HookVariant`. `Html` always exists. `Format(F)` exists only when some `_markup/*.<F>.*` template exists (the reconstruction's `render-table.json.json`). All variants are rendered in C1 and frozen in D. A layout job for format F uses variant `Format(F)` if it exists, else `Html`.

**Cross-page access** (`page_content`, `page_fragments`, `render_shortcodes`, `markdownify` with `page=`) goes through `Memo::get_or_compute` with the caller's `RenderScope`.
- A key already in `scope.chain` is a cycle error naming both positions.
- Two threads computing the same key both finish without blocking; the first `set` wins.

### 3.3 Layout jobs and pagination

**Context.** Each job gets `page` (the full value from the variant's generation), `site`, `hugo`, `lang`, `output_format` and `__nh` (§4.2).

**Pagination is recorded at call time** (Hugo semantics §15.1).
- `paginator()` uses the default list (semantics §15.2) and `pagination.pagerSize`. `paginate(pages=, size=?)` uses a custom list.
- The first call per (page, format) records the `Pagination` and its template position. Later calls behave as follows:

  | Later call | Result |
  |---|---|
  | `paginator()` | the stored pagination |
  | `paginate` with the same ids and size | the stored pagination |
  | `paginate` with a different list or size | error naming both positions |

  The seeksnack conversion drops the redundant second `.Paginate (sort …)`.
- Wave 2 renders pagers 2..N with `__nh.pager = N`. The same calls, including calls inside `partial()`, return pager N.
- A template that never calls either function produces no pager pages. This covers seeksnack's conditional paginator use and its paginated 404 page.

**Autoescape** follows the output format (§4.5).

**Ordering and collisions.**
- Jobs are ordered by `JobOrder` (language, format rank, tree key).
- Target collisions are resolved **before** rendering: a page beats an alias, and among pages the later `JobOrder` wins, with a warning.
- Go picks a nondeterministic winner for seeksnack's 13 colliding term directories. Ours is stable and listed in the ratchet as `accepted-deviation`.

### 3.4 Publishing, placeholders and the deferred wave

**Eager publishing.** Bundle resources of rendered pages whose `publishResources=true` (semantics §22.1) are published once per bundle directory, under the owning language's `target_base`. Translations share the file.

**Publishing on reference.** Assets, remote resources, transformed resources and `publishResources=false` bundles are published only when their URL appears in a template output.
- `Publisher::emit` extracts `UrlTokens` from every output, after decoding HTML entities and JSON escapes. Paths with `&` and `'` (S/R bundles `herrs-salt-&-vinegar…`, `Lay's`) therefore match.
- `execute_as_template` outputs are scanned too, because they are template output.
- Plain CSS and JS files are never scanned: Hugo publishes only through template calls.
- `publish` forces publication.
- Tokens are resolved in E6 against `url → ResourceId`, using both `rel_permalink` and `permalink`.

**Held outputs.**
- Outputs that contain `__nh_defer_<key>__` or `__nh_pp_<id>_<field>__` placeholders are held in memory until E5; everything else is written immediately.
- A `post_process` resource view carries one placeholder per field: `content`, `rel_permalink`, `permalink`, `data.integrity`, `media_type`. `resource_content` returns the content placeholder.
- After patching, tokens are extracted again, so the PostProcess CSS URL is seen.
- Memory is bounded by the placeholder-bearing pages: about 50 MB for docs (all its HTML, because baseof has the deferred block), and a small set for seeksnack.

**Order inside `emit`:**
1. canonify / relative-URL rewrite;
2. collect stats (html5gum);
3. extract URL tokens;
4. hold the output, or minify and write it.

**External tools** (esbuild service, PostCSS, Tailwind, optional Dart Sass) run from rayon workers behind a semaphore of `min(4, cpus)`.

### 3.5 Determinism and where rayon is not used

**Sequential steps:**
- assembly walks B1–B3;
- config loading;
- the stats merge;
- work within one deferred key;
- the language order of E2 sub-waves. Target-path-memoised assets depend on it: Hugo renders languages in order, so the earlier language wins.

**Rules:**
- Every parallel stage collects into indexed or sorted collections before any order-dependent step.
- A render never starts parallel work. `debug_assert!(render_pool.current_thread_index().is_none())` guards every `par_*` call site in our crates. Images are processed in E6.
- The render pool uses `ThreadPoolBuilder::stack_size(16 << 20)`. Render nesting is capped by `__nh.depth ≤ 64`. Tera itself caps component recursion at 20.
- `DashMap` guards are never held while rendering. For example, `partial_cached` runs get → drop → compute → insert.

**Gate from T36 onwards:** the output tree hash is identical with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` and `=8`, and across two runs at `=8`.

---

## 4. Template model

### 4.1 Engine setup

1. **Layout scan.** `LayoutStore::scan` reads the `Layouts` component of the Vfs: project first, then themes.
   - It accepts **only v0.146 names**: `_partials/`, `_shortcodes/`, `_markup/render-<kind>[-<variant>][.<fmt>].<ext>`, `baseof[.<kind>|.<layout>].html`, `home|section|taxonomy|term|single|list|all|<layout>[.<lang>][.<fmt>].<ext>`, `404.html`, `rss.xml`, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `alias.html`, with directory path scopes.
   - Legacy names (`_default/`, `partials/`, `shortcodes/`, `taxonomy/list`, `term/term`, `X-baseof`) are load errors with a rename hint.
   - Names are lower-cased.
   - The legacy → new mapping exists only in the T01 structure-oracle normaliser and in `neohugo-migrate`.
2. **One Tera instance per build**, built inside `Session::new`:
   - `tera.set_fallback_prefixes(["_theme1/", …, "_embedded/"])` is called **before** any template is added. User templates are unprefixed and win. The page scorer knows each template's origin and does not rely on the fallback.
   - `sitefuncs::register`, `funcs::register_pure` and the tera-contrib subset are registered before templates are added, because Tera 2 validates every name when a template is added. Site functions hold `Arc<OnceLock<Weak<dyn ContentRenderer>>>`; the slot is filled after the `Session` `Arc` exists.
   - A **single** `add_raw_templates` call adds user, theme and embedded templates plus the synthesised baseof variants. It validates syntax, names, inheritance and include cycles.
   - Go-template markers (`{{ .`, `{{ end }}`, `{{ define`) give an error that points to `neohugo-rs templates check` and the migrate tool.
3. **The contract instance** (T02, testkit, `templates check`) is identical, except that it calls `funcs::register_placeholders` and registers empty stubs for every `spec::EMBEDDED_TEMPLATES` name not yet written.
4. **Tera features:** `no_fmt`, `fast_hash`, `preserve_order`. Not `fast_escape`, which would stop escaping `'`. `glob_fs` is not used; all loading goes through the Vfs.

### 4.2 Contexts and the render scope

| Render | Top-level names |
|---|---|
| Layout job | `page` (full), `site`, `hugo`, `lang`, `output_format`, `__nh` |
| Shortcode | `page` (full value of the Meta generation: relations yes, content fields no), `site`, `hugo`, `lang`, `shortcode` (`ShortcodeView`), `inner` (safe), `inner_deindent`, `__nh` |
| Render hook | `page` and `page_inner` (Meta generation), `site`, `hugo`, `lang`, `__nh`, plus the hook fields **flattened** (below) |
| `partial(name=…, …)` | the kwargs as top-level names, plus the caller's `page`, `site`, `hugo`, `lang`, `output_format`, and a child `__nh` (same page, format and pager; new frame; depth+1) |
| Component | only its arguments. Implicit `@page`, `@site`, `@hugo`, `@lang` and `@__nh` may be declared (Tera looks each up by name in the caller's scope; `hugo` is in every render that can call a component). |
| `defer` template | `data`, `site`, `hugo`, `__nh` (phase `Deferred`) |
| `execute_as_template` | `data`, `site`, `hugo`, `__nh` |
| Alias | `permalink`, `page` (link), `site`, `hugo` |
| Sitemap, robots, 404 | `page` (the standalone page; its `pages` is `site.pages`), `site`, `hugo`, `lang`, `__nh` |
| Sitemapindex | the same, plus `sites: [{language, sitemap_abs_url, last_mod}]` |

Flattened hook fields, per hook:

| Hook | Fields |
|---|---|
| link, image | `destination`, `title`, `text`, `plain_text`, `is_block`, `attributes`, `ordinal`, `position` |
| heading | `level`, `anchor`, `text`, `plain_text`, `attributes` |
| codeblock | `type`, `inner`, `options`, `attributes`, `ordinal`, `position` |
| blockquote | `type`, `alert_type`, `alert_title`, `alert_sign`, `text`, `attributes`, `ordinal` |
| table | `thead`, `tbody`, `attributes`, `ordinal` |
| passthrough | `type`, `inner`, `attributes`, `ordinal`, `position` |

**How site functions get their scope.** Every site-bound function resolves it with `RenderScope::from_state`.
- Page-relative functions (`store_*`, `param`, `ref`, `rel_ref`, `get_page`, `i18n`, `rel_lang_url`, `related`, `is_menu_current`, `page_content`, …) also accept an explicit `page=` argument. Language and format then come from that page's primary format.
- Inside a component, where `__nh` is invisible unless declared with `@__nh`, a site-bound call without `page=` is an error with a hint.
- `paginator`, `paginate`, `return_value` and `defer` need the real scope, so a component must declare `@__nh` to use them.
- `templates check` lints both rules.

**Tera strictness.**
- Views always emit every documented field. Printing a missing param key is an error, so converted templates print `page.params.x or ""`.
- Nested lookups that may be missing use `?.`, for example `page.params.a?.b` or `page.parent?.title`, because a missing non-final segment is an error even inside `if`.

### 4.3 Layout lookup, baseof, partials, components, shortcodes, hooks, defer

**Lookup.** A pure, data-driven port of Hugo's scorer (semantics §11.4–11.6) using `TemplateRole` and `Score`.
- The first path segment is replaced by `type` when `type` differs from the section.
- Candidates come from walking from the root down to the query path.
- A user template beats a theme template, which beats an embedded one. Link and image hooks follow `useEmbedded`.
- Selections are computed eagerly in B7.
- No match gives a warning and no file; standalone pages are skipped silently.

**Baseof.**
- A layout that begins with `{% extends "baseof.html" %}` requests Hugo's base resolution.
- For every (layout L, resolved baseof B) pair where B is not the root `baseof.html`, a variant `TemplateName` `L@@B` is registered with its `extends` literal rewritten to B.
- The three target sites each have one root baseof, so no variants are created for them.
- An explicit `{% extends "other.html" %}` is left alone.
- A child `{% block %}` that its parent does not define is a Tera load error. Conversion deletes such blocks, for example the docs `home.html` `leftsidebar`.

**Partials** (conversion rule in §4.7):

| Hugo partial | Tera form |
|---|---|
| shares the caller's context (`partial "x" .`) | `{% include "_partials/x.html" %}` |
| literal name with dict arguments | a **component**, defined in `_partials/` files (`{% component breadcrumbs(page, sep="/", @lang) %}`) and called as `{{ <breadcrumbs page=page /> }}` |
| dynamic name, or returns a value | the function `partial(name=…, …)` |

- Component calls are validated at load time.
- `partial()` details:
  - It allocates a `FrameId` in `Handles.frames` and puts it into the child `__nh`.
  - **`return_value(value=expr)`** writes to that frame and prints nothing.
  - On exit, if the frame was set, `partial()` returns that value (a map, list or resource view). Otherwise it returns the rendered string, marked safe in HTML templates.
  - Nested value-returning partials work, because each call has its own frame id. This covers the docs partials `get-featured-image`, `get-page-images`, `get-github-info`, `get-remote-data`, `color-from-string` and `get-resource`.
- `partial_cached(name=, key=, …)` memoises the full `PartialResult` (string or value) on (name, key).
- `set_global` inside an include is discarded by Tera, so values flow out of partials only through `partial()` + `return_value`.

**Components** are global and can recurse, which suits docs `render-toc-level`/`docs-explorer-section` and seeksnack `breadcrumbnav`. They are hygienic: see the scope rules in §4.2.

**Shortcodes.**
- `_shortcodes/<name>.html` (and `.md` / `.txt`) are ordinary Tera templates, looked up with path scope, output format and language.
- Positional arguments are `shortcode.args`, named arguments `shortcode.params`. `shortcode | arg(index=0, default="")` and `shortcode | arg(name="src", default="")` give Hugo's `.Get` with its missing-value rules.
- Content keeps Hugo's syntax exactly.
- Shortcodes cannot be components, because Hugo shortcodes take positional arguments.

**Render hooks.**
- `TeraHooks` implements `markup::Hooks`: it looks up `_markup/render-<kind>[-<variant>][.<format>].html` and renders it with `page_inner` from `HookEnv`.
- A hook for a non-default output format falls back to the HTML hook.
- Embedded link and image hooks apply when `useEmbedded` resolves to `fallback`, the default in multilingual single-host sites (T and S).
- The embedded table hook's default output is produced natively in Rust unless a user or theme hook exists.
- Under `CodeFences::Plain`, no code-block hook runs.

**`templates.Defer`** becomes `{{ defer(template="_partials/deferred/tailwind.html", key="global", data=…) }}`. It returns a placeholder; the template is rendered once per key in E5.

### 4.4 What each phase can see

| Data | Content phase (shortcodes, hooks, `markdownify`) | Layout phase |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata, URLs, params, resources, terms of any page | summary and full values of the Meta generation | summary and full values of the Full generation for the job's variant |
| Relations of a listed page | `p \| deref` or `get_page(path=p.path)` | the same |
| Raw source (`raw_content`, after the front matter) of any page | field of the Meta generation (known after parsing, before rendering) | the same |
| Content-derived data of this or another page | functions `page_content(page=)`, `page_summary`, `page_plain`, `page_word_count`, `page_fragments`, `page_toc`, `render_shortcodes(page=)`: lazy, memoised, cycle-checked through `__nh.chain` | fields `p.content`, `p.summary`, `p.plain`, `p.fragments`, … (the functions also work) |
| Content of a bundled content resource | `resource_content` on a view with `page_id` → that page's HTML (safe) | the same |
| Page store | `store_set(key=, value=)`, `store_get(key=)`; writes buffered per transaction | writes applied directly; visible later in the same render |
| Template-local state | `{% set %}`, `{% set_global %}`, `merge` | the same |

The docs `quick-reference` shortcode reads `.Content` of child sections, and becomes `page_content(page=s)`. Using a content field in the content phase produces Tera's undefined-field error, plus a sitefuncs note: `Field 'content' is not available in the content phase; use page_content(page=…)`.

### 4.5 Escaping

**Autoescape.** Tera's autoescape is set with `autoescape_on([".html", ".htm", ".xml", ".svg"])`.
- Output formats with `Escaping::Plain` are registered under plain-text alias names, so the format decides, not the file name. `home.redir`, `home.headers`, `home.json`, `index.json` and `robots.txt` are not escaped. HTML, `list.rss.xml` and `sitemap.xml` are escaped.
- An include inherits the caller's mode.

**Safe outputs.** Functions and filters that produce HTML are safe: `partial` (HTML mode), components, `markdownify`, `render_string`, `render_shortcodes`, `page_content`, `highlight`, `emojify`, `to_math`, `diagrams_goat`, `jsonify`, `html_escape`. Content, summary, TOC, hook `text` and `inner` are inserted as safe strings.

**`html_escape`** always escapes, even an input marked safe, and returns a safe value. Hugo `html`, `htmlEscape` and `transform.HTMLEscape` map to it; R `rss.xml` `{{ .Summary | html }}` is the case that needs it. Tera's `escape` leaves safe values alone, so it is not used for these.

**No contextual escaping.**
- In `<script>`, use `jsonify | safe`. `jsonify` escapes `<`, `>` and `&` as `\u003c`, `\u003e` and `\u0026`.
- In query strings, use `urlencode`.
- `safeHTML`, `safeHTMLAttr`, `safeURL`, `safeJS` and `safeCSS` all become `safe`.
- `#ZgotmplZ` has no equivalent (D5).
- Escaped bytes differ from html/template's (T60): Tera writes `"` as `&quot;` and leaves `+`, Go writes `&#34;` and `&#43;`. The text is the same after entity decoding (L3); an embedded template that must match Go byte for byte avoids such characters or escapes itself.

### 4.6 Function, filter and test catalogue

Frozen as `neohugo_funcs::spec::FUNCS` by T02. `template-api.md` is generated from it.

**Kind codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| op | Tera operator or syntax |
| bi | Tera built-in |
| tc | tera-contrib |
| F | our filter |
| fn | our function |
| T | test |
| (s) | site-bound (neohugo-sitefuncs); everything else is pure (neohugo-funcs) |

**Naming.**
- Tera built-ins are never overridden.
- Names follow Tera/Zola verb_noun style.
- Hugo concept names stay (`ref`, `rel_ref`, `abs_url`, `paginate`, `i18n`, `by_*`).

**Sites:** D = docs, S = real seeksnack, R = reconstruction, T = testsite.

**Tera strings.** Tera 2.4 string literals know only the escapes `\n` `\t` `\r` `\"` `\'` `\/` `\\`; any other escape (`"\u{a0}"`, `"\s"`) is a syntax error. Write other characters literally (a U+00A0 character for Go's `printf "%c" 160`) and double the backslashes of regular expressions (`regex_replace(pattern="^\\s+", …)`).

**tera-contrib** supplies `regex_replace`, `urlencode`, `base64`, `filesizeformat` and `matching`. Its `date` filter is used only if T12 confirms that it produces Gregorian Thai month names (`th-u-ca-gregory`); otherwise neohugo-locale registers `date` itself. `shuffle` is not registered, because no target site uses it and it needs the `rand` feature.

### 4.7 Conversion rules

These rules are generated into `template-api.md`. They are applied by hand; the optional migrate tool (T73) applies them too.

**Names and paths.**
- Files use v0.146 names (§4.1). Include and extends literals are lower-case, new-style names.
- `.Title` → `page.title`; `.Site.X` and `site.X` → `site.x`.
- Params are lower-cased: `.Site.Params.HomeTitle` → `site.params.hometitle`.
- Data keys keep their case: `item.Name`, `site.data.docs.config.baseURL`.
- Reserved front-matter keys stay available in params: `where … "Params.type"` → `[p for p in l if p.params.type == "snacks"]`.

**Missing values.**
- Printed params that may be missing → `page.params.x or ""`.
- Nested optional lookups use `?.`.
- Hugo `default` → `default_if_empty(value=)`. Do not use `or` for bools.

**Comparisons.**
- `eq $p $currentSection` → `p.id == current_section.id`. Pagers compare by `page_number`, dates by `.unix`.
- Mixed int/string comparisons get explicit `int` or `str`, for example R `ge site.params.yearcreate (now | date(format="%Y") | int)`.

**Control flow.**
- `{{ with X }}…{{ else with Y }}` → `{% if X %}{% set x = X %}…{% elif Y %}…`.
- `range $k, $v := m` → `{% for k, v in m %}`. Maps from views, data and filters are built sorted. Template literals need `| sort_keys` before ranging.
- `where` → list comprehension with `if`. `apply` → comprehension. `seq N` → `range(start=1, end=N+1)`.
- Variable reassignment inside a block → `set_global` (it is discarded inside includes).

**Templates and partials.**
- `define`/`block` in children → `{% extends "baseof.html" %}` plus `{% block %}`. Delete blocks the parent does not define.
- Partials → include, component or `partial()` (§4.3).
- `try` → `optional=true` on `get_remote` and `to_math`, or a `none` check.

**Formatting.**
- Go `printf` → `~`, `pad_start`/`pad_end`, `round`/`format_number`, `jsonify`, as in §4.6.
- Tera strings know only `\n \t \r \" \' \/ \\`: other characters literally (U+00A0), regex backslashes doubled (`"\\s+"`).
- Go date layouts → strftime (`"Jan 2, 2006"` → `"%b %-d, %Y"`).

**Removed Hugo idioms.**
- `range .Paginator.Pages` → `{% for p in paginator().pages %}`. Delete a second `.Paginate` that follows `.Paginator`.
- `{{ $noop := .WordCount }}` → delete.
- Another page's `.Content` inside a shortcode → `page_content(page=p)`.
- `.Scratch` / `newScratch` → `set`, `set_global`, `merge`; the page store only for cross-template flags.

**Components.** A component that calls site-bound functions passes `page=` or declares `@__nh`.

**Escaping.** `html`/`htmlEscape` → `html_escape`. In `<script>`, use `jsonify | safe`. In query strings, use `urlencode`.

**Assets and i18n.**
- Assets used with `execute_as_template` are Tera templates: `{{ .api }}` → `{{ data.api }}`.
- i18n files stay Hugo syntax, limited to `{{ . }}` and `{{ .Field }}` (§2.4 locale).


**Tera 2.4 syntax limits found in T35 (binding for every conversion, T60–T66):**
- No attribute or index access after a call or a parenthesised expression: `get_page(path=x).title`, `paginator().page_number` and `(x | f).y` are syntax errors. Bind first (`{% set p = get_page(path=x) %}{{ p.title }}`) or use `| get(key=…)` / `| get_path(path=[…])`.
- `}}` inside an expression ends the tag: write nested map literals with a space, `{"a": {"b": 1} }`.
- Functions receive no call position; pagination conflicts report the partial or layout the call ran in.

### 4.8 Template tooling

**Contract test** (`neohugo-testkit::contract`, T02).
- It builds the contract instance from `spec::FUNCS` placeholders plus stubs for `spec::EMBEDDED_TEMPLATES`, then parses every template under `rust/sites/**/{layouts,assets,patches}` and `crates/layouts/embedded/**`.
- A second test snapshots `template-api.md` against `FUNCS`.
- So layout conversion can start as soon as T02 lands.

**`neohugo-rs templates check -s <site>`** (T37):
1. Loads the layouts and reports parse errors and unknown names, with Tera `ReportError` snippets (file:line:col).
2. Reports top-level names from `get_template_variables` that are not in the documented context for that template's role.
3. Lists lookup coverage for every (page, format) query of the site, and every shortcode and hook referenced by the content. It shows the chosen template and baseof, and "no match" rows.
4. Lints:
   - legacy layout names and literals;
   - site-bound calls inside components without `page=` or `@__nh`;
   - `partial(name="<literal>")` with arguments (should be a component);
   - content fields used in shortcode or hook templates;
   - Go-template markers;
   - map literals ranged without `sort_keys`.

## 5. Dependencies

Versions are from crates.io as of 2026-09-29. `(verify)` marks feature names or versions that T00 must confirm. T00 has network access, runs `cargo fetch --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and commits `Cargo.lock`. Features are declared **only** in `[workspace.dependencies]`.

**External binaries**, run through `security.exec`:
- `esbuild` over the `--service` protocol. Its version is read from `esbuild --version`; it is pinned by `tools/esbuild/build.sh`.
- `postcss-cli` and the `@tailwindcss/cli` v4 CLI, installed by `tools/neohugo/node.sh` from a committed lockfile into `tools/neohugo/node_modules`. Both the Go and Rust builds use it.
- An optional `sass` (Dart Sass) binary, used when `transpiler = "dartsass"` is set.

**Not used:**
- giallo (EUPL-1.2; cannot emit Chroma classes);
- pulldown-cmark (the fallback only if T04 fails comrak);
- serde_yaml (deprecated), libsass, reqwest, tree-sitter grammars;
- imagequant (GPL-3.0), zenwebp (AGPL), nom-exif (non-standard licence);
- `arc-swap` (generations are frozen in `OnceLock`s);
- any Zola ≥ 0.22 source.

**Licence policy** (`rust/deny.toml`, cargo-deny format).
- `tools/neohugo/licence-check.sh` evaluates **SPDX expressions** from `cargo metadata --filter-platform x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, using Python stdlib.
- Allowlist: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC, Zlib, CC0-1.0, Unlicense, BSL-1.0, Unicode-3.0, CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (webpki roots), MPL-2.0 (lightningcss/cssparser, file-level copyleft).
- An `OR` expression passes if any branch passes. So `MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR LGPL-2.1-or-later` (r-efi) passes; `Apache-2.0 AND ISC` (ring) needs both.
- Bans: any EUPL, GPL or AGPL-only expression, plus the crates giallo, imagequant, zenwebp and nom-exif.
- The check runs in T00 and at every phase end. `cargo deny check licenses bans` can replace the script later without redefining the policy.
- Embedded templates (derived from Hugo, Apache-2.0) and non-cargo assets are recorded in `THIRD_PARTY/`: two-face syntaxes and themes, CLDR data, emoji data, livereload.js.

**Heavy-dependency isolation:**

| Heavy dependency | Isolated in |
|---|---|
| minify-html (oxc, lightningcss) | `minify` |
| image, webp (C) | `images` |
| syntect dumps | `highlight` |
| ICU data | `locale` |
| axum, tokio | `serve` |
| svgbob, pulldown-latex | `funcs`, behind features `goat` and `math` |

## 6. Fate of the existing crates and the Go oracles

### 6.1 T00 order of operations

1. `git tag go-parity-final` on the I01 byte-identical state.
2. Move the retained fixtures and corpora (§6.3) to `rust/testdata/`. Convert them to plain JSON with the neohugo schema using `tools/neohugo/fixtures2json.py` (stdlib; unwraps the `goval`/`tval` type tags; re-run after any oracle regeneration). Update `sites.py` paths.
3. Move `crates/TERA_PLAN.md` to `docs/rust-port/TERA_PLAN.md`, with a header pointing to this plan.
4. `git rm -r crates/`, then `rm -rf crates/`. The second command also removes the ignored `crates/*/target` directories (`go-png/target` alone is 257 MB). Together they free 423 MB.
5. Delete the byte-exact Go oracle directories (§6.4).
6. Add `rust/target/`, `tools/neohugo/bin/` and `tools/neohugo/node_modules/` to `.gitignore`.

From then on, salvage uses `git show go-parity-final:crates/<crate>/<path>`. No legacy code remains in the working tree.

### 6.2 Salvage map

| Legacy crate(s) | Fate | Salvaged into (task) |
|---|---|---|
| go-value, go-unicode, go-strconv, go-fmt, go-sort, go-path, go-flate, go-html, go-json, go-url, go-image, go-png, go-hashstructure | delete | ecosystem crates (§5) |
| go-time | delete | Hugo's accepted date formats, expressed as jiff `strptime` patterns → `base` (T10); Go-layout → strftime table → `page::PermalinkPattern` (T21) and `migrate` (T73) |
| go-yaml, xtext-collate, goldmark, tdewolff-parse(-js), tdewolff-minify(-js), libwebp-sys, libsass-sys | delete | serde-saphyr, icu_collator, comrak, minify-html/lightningcss/oxc, webp, grass. Their corpora move to `testdata/corpus`. |
| gift | delete | **No transliteration.** Filters are built on `image::imageops` and `imageproc` (gaussian blur, median, `filter3x3`, rotate; T41 verifies names). Fresh code only for Sigmoid, Colorize, ColorBalance, Sepia, Pixelate (and Dither, COULD). Hugo's 16 resample names map onto fast_image_resize's 7 filters through a documented table, with a warning for approximations. The anchor-point maths → `images` (T41). |
| gotemplate | delete | `parse/{lex,parse,node}.rs` → front end of `migrate` (T73, COULD) |
| nh-common | delete | `paths/{pathparser,path,url}.rs` rules → `base::paths` + `vfs::PathParser` (T10, T20); `urls`, `kinds`, `htime` → `base` (T10); flect/prose rules → `base::inflect`/`title`, crate or own data tables (T10); `files` classifier → `vfs` (T20) |
| nh-allconfig, nh-config, nh-langs, nh-media | delete | default values and key names (as `impl Default`), config-dir and env merge rules, legacy-key table, `HUGO_*` mapping, security policy, `hexec`, media and output-format tables → `config` (T13) |
| nh-hugofs | delete | mount semantics (lang, include/exclude, theme order, `_jsconfig`) → `vfs` (T20) |
| nh-parser | delete | page lexer rules, re-expressed as `lex` + `assemble` over `&str` → `pageparser` (T11) |
| nh-i18n | delete | message file formats, count extraction, fallback → `locale` (T12) |
| nh-page | delete | `page_frontmatter`, `page_matcher`, `permalinks`, `page_paths`, `pages_sort` → `page` (T21); `taxonomy`, `weighted` → `site` (T23b); `menu`, `pagemenus`, `pagination`, `pagegroup`, `related` → `nav` (T24) |
| nh-hugolib, nh-doctree | delete | capture, assembly, cascade, dates, build options → `site` (T23a); URLs, relations, taxonomies, `Dir()` retry → `site` (T23b); shortcode/summary/content rules → `render` (T34); render order, aliases, stats format, redirects → `build` (T36) |
| nh-markup | delete | hook contracts, TOC, autoid (github/github-ascii/blackfriday), attribute parser, alert parse → `markup` (T22), `highlight` (T25) |
| nh-tplimpl | delete | `templatedescriptor.rs` scoring rules re-expressed as `TemplateRole` + `Score` → `layouts` (T30); embedded list → T32; legacy mapping → T01 normaliser and `migrate` only |
| nh-tplfuncs | delete | sort-by-key with collator, set operations, HTML-aware truncate, urls, transform, lang, crypto, os policy → `funcs`, `sitefuncs` (T31, T35). Not `where`, `printf` or Scratch. |
| nh-resource(s), nh-resource-transformers | delete | metadata matching (`src` globs, `:counter`), naming, `integrity.rs` (copied; sha2/md5/base64), bundler, Sass import resolution + `hugo:vars`, PostCSS spawn + inline imports, GetRemote options, postpub per-field placeholders, jsconfig → `resources` (T40, T42) |
| nh-esbuild | **keep** `service/{protocol,client}.rs` (std only, our own Apache code); salvage `options.rs`, `resolve.rs`, `sourcemap.rs` | `esbuild` (T14) |
| nh-images | delete | spec grammar (`config.rs`), process semantics, filter-name mapping, overlay/mask/padding/opacity/auto_orient → `images` (T41) |
| nh-transform, nh-publisher | delete | canonify/relative URL replacers, minify config mapping, stats collector semantics → `publish` (T50) |
| nh-helpers | delete | URLize/MakePath/RelURL/AbsURL, word count/summary/reading time, filecache config → `base`, `markup`, `resources` |
| nh-commands | delete | flag mapping, build flow, fsync copy semantics → `cli` (T37), `publish` (T50) |
| nh-tpl, nh-deps | delete | – |

### 6.3 Fixtures and corpora moved in T00 (to `rust/testdata/`, converted to plain JSON)

**Needed by `sites.py`:**
- `nh-allconfig/tests/fixtures/load/seeksnack/hugo.toml`
- `nh-hugolib/tests/fixtures/build/*.json.gz`
- `nh-resource-transformers/tests/fixtures/getremote/getremote.json.gz`
- `go-image/tests/fixtures/site/*.jpg`
- `go-png/tests/fixtures/{repo,golden}/*.png`
- `nh-tplimpl/tests/fixtures/probe/probe.json.gz`

**Oracles** (`testdata/oracle/`):
- `nh-hugolib/{capture,assemble,content,site,build}`
- `nh-page/{paths,permalinks,pagination,menus,related,collections,frontmatter,summary,misc}`
- `nh-tplimpl/{lookup,store}`, `nh-allconfig/load`, `nh-media`
- `nh-parser/{pageparser,metadecoders}`, `nh-markup/{hooks,autoid,convert}`, `nh-i18n/{plural,translate}`
- `nh-resources`, `nh-resource-transformers/{jsbuild,postcss,tocss}`, `nh-images/{config,process,exif}`
- `nh-publisher/collector`, `nh-transform/absurl`
- `nh-commands/{e2e,cli,staticcopy}` (including `e2e/mini.txtar`), `nh-helpers/pathspec`, `nh-common/{paths,urls}`
- **kept for title and date parity:** `nh-common/{flect,prose,locales,cast,glob}`
- the xtext-collate Thai corpora

**Corpora** (`testdata/corpus/`):
- `goldmark/corpus{,-ext}.gmf.gz` (251 seeksnack bodies)
- `go-yaml/seeksnack-fm.fixture.gz` (218 front matters)
- `go-time/{format,seeksnack}.txt.gz`
- `tdewolff-minify/corpus/*`
- `golden/hugo_stats.json` (stays under `tools/rust-port/golden`)

**How they are used.** Tests deserialise fixtures into `#[derive(Deserialize)]` structs and compare semantic fields only. Each crate keeps a reviewed `expected_diffs.toml` (YAML 1.1 booleans, CLDR collation, and so on).

### 6.4 Go oracles (`tools/go-oracle/`)

**Kept**, with output re-pointed to `rust/testdata/oracle/` (plus the `fixtures2json.py` step):
- `nh-hugolib/*`, `nh-page/*`, `nh-tplimpl/lookup`, `nh-allconfig/load`, `nh-media/*`
- `nh-parser/{pageparser,metadecoders}`, `nh-markup/{hooks,autoid,convert}`, `nh-i18n/*`
- `nh-resources/*`, `nh-images/{config,process}`, `nh-publisher/collector`, `nh-transform/absurl`
- `nh-commands/*`, `nh-helpers/pathspec`
- `nh-common/{paths,urls,flect,prose,locales,cast,glob}`

These need only native Go; the arm64/qemu requirement ends.

**Deleted in T00:**
- `go-*`, `gift`, `goldmark`, `gotemplate`, `tdewolff-*`, `xtext-collate`, `libwebp-sys`, `libsass-sys`
- `nh-common/{compare,regexp,norm,values,math}`
- `nh-tplimpl/escdump`, `nh-doctree/walkmut`
- `tools/rust-port/i01/build-go-arm64.sh`

**Added in T01: `structure`.** It builds a site with hugolib and dumps, for every (lang, page, output format):
- kind, path, outputs, target file name, permalink and rel permalink;
- the **chosen layout template and baseof**, as Hugo's own internal v0.146 descriptor path, so legacy names come out normalised;
- alias targets;
- (page, resource name) → rel permalink, including shared translation resources.

It also dumps each site's layout file list with normalised names, which T30 uses as its scorer input.

---

## 7. Testing and acceptance

### 7.1 Test layers

1. **Unit tests** inside modules, except in `view`, `sitefuncs`, `render`, `build` and `cli`. Each crate has one integration binary, `tests/it/main.rs`.
2. **Oracle-fixture tests** (`tests/it/oracle.rs`) on the §6.3 fixtures: semantic fields only, with `expected_diffs.toml`.
3. **insta snapshots:**
   - config decodes of the three sites;
   - the layout-lookup table per site;
   - markdown for about 150 curated docs and seeksnack bodies plus an adversarial set (html, toc, fragments, hook-call log with `page_inner`);
   - function outputs;
   - `template-api.md` against `FUNCS`;
   - embedded templates rendered against testsite views (in T60: `neohugo/tests/it/embedded.rs`, a test-only overlay of the testsite);
   - the full testsite output tree (56 files: 55 in `public` plus `hugo_stats.json`; `neohugo/tests/it/snapshots/testsite_output.snap`).

   Hashes, timestamps and versions are redacted. Snapshots are reviewed with `INSTA_UPDATE=always` plus `git diff`.
4. **Robustness corpora.** All 959 docs files and all 251 seeksnack bodies render without a panic, with idempotent heading IDs.
5. **Contract test and `templates check`** (§4.8).
6. **Site integration tests** (`neohugo-build/tests/it/sites.rs`).
   - Built into a `MemorySink` and compared with the structure oracle: `mini.txtar`, the testsite, the seeksnack reconstruction and the edge-tree txtar sites.
   - Edge cases covered: cascade, i18n, aliases, term collisions, headless, `build` options, Thai paths, FM overrides, HTML content, Unicode shortcode params.
   - Docs is built only by the acceptance script.
7. **Determinism** (from T36): identical output-tree hash for `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` vs `=8`, and for two runs at `=8`.

### 7.2 Harness: manifests, structdiff, ratchet

All of this is Python stdlib under `tools/neohugo/`; there is no pip dependency.

- **One extractor for both sides.** `manifest.py` runs over the Go output and the Rust output alike. It uses `html.parser`, `xml.etree` and `json`, and reads PNG/JPEG/WebP headers for dimensions.
- **Two passes per site:**
  - The **minified** pass (I01 flags `--minify --clock 2026-09-27T12:00:00Z`) is used for L1 and L4.
  - The **unminified** pass is used for L2 and L3.
- **Build environment.** Both builds run with outbound HTTP disabled (proxy variables pointed at a refusing port) and with `tools/neohugo/node_modules` on the path. `compare.sh` deletes outputs unless `KEEP=1`.
- **Levels:**

| Level | Checks |
|---|---|
| **L1 paths** | Equal multisets of output paths after normalisation: `_hu_[0-9a-f]+` → `_hu_H`; fingerprints `.[0-9a-f]{16,64}.` → `.H.`; the known collision directories collapsed. Plus the structure oracle: per (page, format) the same target, permalink and chosen template; per (page, resource) the same rel permalink. |
| **L2 links** | HTML: same `<title>`, same `<link rel=canonical\|alternate>`, same set of normalised internal `href`/`src`/`srcset`. **Normalisation percent-decodes and NFC-normalises URL attributes** (Go's html/template percent-encodes non-ASCII; Tera does not). Alias → target map equal (including `page/1/` and `/en/`). RSS/sitemap/sitemapindex: same `<link>`/`<loc>`/`<guid>` lists. JSON: same key structure and URL leaves. `_redirects`/`_headers`: same line sets. **Link integrity:** every internal link in our output resolves to one of our files. |
| **L3 text** | Visible text after collapsing whitespace, decoding entities and mapping typographic characters to ASCII; a tag boundary separates words except a `span`'s inside `pre`/`code` (highlighter token spans, T66). Heading-ID lists per page. `hugo_stats.json` tag, class and id sets. |
| **L4 assets** | Images: equal (width, height, format). Static files: byte-equal (sha256). CSS/JS: non-empty and referenced. |

- **Ratchet.**
  - `rust/testdata/baselines/<site>.json` stores each file's per-level status and a diff fingerprint.
  - A task may add or change entries only by listing them in `tools/neohugo/changes/<task-id>.md`, each with one triage class (`engine-difference`, `bug-fixed` or `accepted-deviation`) and a one-line reason.
  - An unlisted new diff fails the run. Baselines are reviewed at every phase end.
- **Self-test** (`selftest.py`): synthetic perturbations of the Go output, each checked for the right classification:
  - drop a file;
  - add a file;
  - change an internal link;
  - reorder attributes (must be ignored);
  - percent-encode a Thai href (must be ignored);
  - split a code element into token spans (must be ignored; T66);
  - change visible text;
  - change image dimensions;
  - change an RSS item link.
- **Tracked metric (A7).** Per-page visible-text equality ratio, reported with the worst 20 pages at every parity task.

### 7.3 Acceptance gates

**Docs patch variants** (T01 writes them as `tools/rust-port/i01/patches.json`, from `sites.py`'s `DOCS_*` lists; each layout entry maps to a Tera patch file under `rust/sites/docs/patches/<variant>/`):

| `sites.py` entry | i01 | reduced |
|---|---|---|
| remove `news/_content.gotmpl`, `shortcodes/x.md` (network), `functions/images/Text.md` (font GetRemote), `hugo_stats.json` | ✓ | ✓ |
| remove `shortcodes/qr.md`, `functions/images/{QR,Dither}.md` (COULD) | ✓ | ✓ |
| remove `quick-reference/syntax-highlighting-styles.md` (Chroma style gallery) | ✓ | ✓ (T72) |
| remove `shortcodes/highlight.md` | ✓ | – |
| `get-featured-image` Text → Grayscale; `header/qr.html`, `hooks/body-main-start.html` QR → Resize; `get-github-info.html` stub (DOCS_WRITE); smartcrop → anchors in content | ✓ | ✓ |
| baseof Tailwind → `minify`; Alpine/Turbo import stubs | ✓ | – (node.sh provides the modules) |
| passthrough off, emoji off, `codeFences = false`; render-codeblock / `hl` / code-toggle highlight → printf; remarshal → json | ✓ | – |

**Gates:**

| Gate | Site | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| **A-T** | hugolib/testsite + `testsite.txtar` | L1 56/56 (Go's 55 files in `public`, the reference `neohugo-build/tests/it/testsite-go.txtar`, plus `hugo_stats.json`, which Go writes to the project directory and the reference does not hold) plus structure oracle; L2 all; L3 equal on every page (ratchet entries only `accepted-deviation`); `hugo_stats.json` sets equal |
| **A-R** | seeksnack reconstruction | L1 713/713 (712 files in `public` plus `hugo_stats.json` in the project directory; T61's count of 712 is `public` alone) plus structure oracle (incl. resource URLs); L2 all; A7 ≥ 0.95 with a clean ratchet. Must include: <ul><li>i18n with messages and Thai dates;</li><li>pagination (incl. 404 paging);</li><li>sitemapindex, the `/en/` redirect, robots;</li><li>the JSON output with `render-table.json.json`;</li><li>Sass via grass;</li><li>PostCSS purge reading stats (node.sh);</li><li>ExecuteAsTemplate TS assets (one file per target);</li><li>PostProcess per-field placeholders;</li><li>FM overrides, HTML content, content resources.</li></ul> R's `v1.html` inner rendering is `accepted-deviation`. |
| **A-D1** | docs, `--docs-patches i01` | L1 888/888 (887 in `public` plus `hugo_stats.json`) plus structure oracle; L2 all; heading-ID lists equal on every page; A7 ≥ 0.90 with a clean ratchet. Fences are plain `<pre><code>` (`codeFences = false`). |
| **A-D2** | docs, `--docs-patches reduced` | Working: <ul><li>Chroma-class highlighting (incl. `hl` inline/noClasses and `highlight.md`);</li><li>goat diagrams (`diagrams_goat`);</li><li>emoji;</li><li>passthrough + `to_math`;</li><li>`remarshal` in `code-toggle`;</li><li>Tailwind through `defer`;</li><li>real Alpine/Turbo `js_build`.</li></ul> L1 equal to the Go build with the same patches (889: 888 in `public` plus `hugo_stats.json`; `shortcodes/highlight.md` is kept); L2 all. Math and goat pages are `accepted-deviation` at L3. |
| **A-S** | real seeksnack (needs the private repo, D6) | L1 path set equals `tools/rust-port/golden/canonical.sha256` (6,943 paths, normalised); static files byte-equal; L2 on 100 sampled pages |
| **A-DET** | all sites | byte-identical across `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1/8` and across repeated runs |
| **A-P** | performance (goals, not gates) | **Release profile**, measured in T70 after `cargo clean` of the dev artifacts, with no agents active: docs cold build ≤ 1.5× the Go time on this machine, warm (image cache) ≤ 1.0×, peak RSS ≤ 1 GB |

**Allowed differences** (always listed in the ratchet, never silent):
- minifier bytes;
- highlight span structure;
- typographic characters versus entities;
- CSS/JS bundle bytes;
- deterministic term-collision winners;
- order of equal-weight Thai titles (CLDR version);
- the `generator` meta;
- KaTeX HTML → MathML;
- goat SVG bytes.

### 7.4 Converting the target sites' templates

- The Tera files live in `rust/sites/<site>/{layouts,assets,patches}` with **v0.146 names**. The seeksnack reconstruction's legacy files are renamed; the structure oracle already normalises the Go side.
- `sites.py --overlay rust/sites/<site> [--docs-patches i01|reduced]` generates each site as today, then:
  - replaces `layouts/`;
  - overlays `assets/` files (Tera versions of template-processed assets);
  - for docs, layers `patches/<variant>/`.
- Content, i18n, data and all other assets are shared unchanged. The Go side always builds the original, Go-patched layouts.
- A check (`sites.py patches --check`) asserts that `patches.json` and `rust/sites/docs/patches/**` correspond 1:1.

| Site | Files | Tera lines (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| testsite | 5 | ~100 |
| seeksnack reconstruction | 46 layouts + ~3 TS assets | ~900 |
| docs | 76 (44 partials, 23 shortcodes, 5 hooks, 7 top-level) + 11 patch files (2 variants) | ~3,600 |
| embedded (used ones only) | ~30 | ~1,200 |
| real seeksnack | 58 | ~900 (private repo, T73) |

Each converted file is reviewed against §4.7 and the contract test. Faithfulness is measured with L2/L3 per page, and the worst 20 pages are reviewed in every parity task.

### 7.5 Commands

- Per crate: `cargo test -p <crate>`, run in the agent's own worktree.
- Phase end only: `cargo clippy -p <crate>` for each crate of the phase, and `tools/neohugo/licence-check.sh`.
- Acceptance: `tools/neohugo/compare.sh <site> [--docs-patches i01|reduced] [KEEP=1]`.
- Templates: `neohugo-rs templates check -s <site-dir>`.

## 8. Phased task breakdown

### 8.1 Rules for parallel agents

**Worktrees.**
- Each agent works in its own git worktree, `git worktree add ../wt/<task> -b task/<id> rust-port` (about 55 MB each).
- Every worktree sets `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/user/neohugo/rust/target`. Registry artifacts are shared. Workspace crates compile per worktree path; they are small.
- An agent never compiles another agent's half-edited crate. Only green commits are merged into `rust-port`, and a task rebases before merging.
- **Crate lock.** At most one agent edits a given crate at a time.
  - Parity tasks own only `rust/sites/**`, `rust/testdata/baselines/**` and `tools/neohugo/changes/**`.
  - A bug found in a crate becomes a short **fix task** that takes that crate's lock.

**Build commands.**
- Only `cargo test -p <crate>`, plus `-p` of direct dependants after an API change.
- Never `cargo check`, `clippy` or `doc` in the edit–test loop.
- Never `--workspace`; never `--release` before T70; never `cargo clean` (`cargo clean -p X` only when coordinated).
- `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4`.

**Disk budget and guard.** After T00 about 4.9 GB is free, and T01's `go clean -cache -modcache` frees about 2.2 GB more.

| Consumer | Planned |
|---|---|
| registry | ~0.8 GB |
| `rust/target` | ≤ 2.5 GB |
| `node_modules` | ~0.2 GB |
| worktrees | ~0.3 GB |
| site outputs (transient) | ~0.3 GB |

`tools/neohugo/disk.sh` fails if `rust/target` exceeds 2.5 GB **or** `df` reports less than 700 MB free. Every task reports `du -sh rust/target` and `df -h /` when it ends.

**Network.** T00 needs network for `cargo fetch`, and T01 for `npm ci` and GOPROXY (D8). Builds and tests afterwards run offline.

**Go.** T01 builds the native Go binary and the `structure` oracle once, keeps the binaries under `tools/neohugo/bin/` (gitignored), then runs `go clean -cache -modcache`.

**Clean room.**
- Implementing agents never open Zola ≥ 0.22 source; `scratchpad/zola-ref` is taken out of agents' reach at T00.
- Pre-3c9131db MIT Zola files (only if D2 = b) are fetched as single raw files, committed verbatim first with an MIT header, recorded in `PROVENANCE.md`, then adapted.

**Review checklist per task:** the §1.2 rules (typed model, no thread-locals, no Go-order emulation, no Go error texts, no Zola-isms), plus the task's own acceptance criteria.

### 8.3 Schedule (four lanes) and critical path

**Lanes.**
- Lane A: the model and the critical path.
- Lane B: templates, markup and render.
- Lane C: harness, output and resources.
- Lane D: layout conversion, images and nav. Lane D is mostly Tera writing plus the light crates, so it adds little CPU contention.

| Round | Lane A | Lane B | Lane C | Lane D |

| 1 | **T00** | – | T01 (Go program first; sites.py after T00 merges) | – |
| 2 | **T10** | T02 | T04 | – |

- **Critical path:** T00 → T10 → T13 → T20 → T21 → T23a → T23b → T33 → T34 → T36 → T37 → T60 → T65. That is 13 serial rounds. A-D2 follows in round 14 and cleanup in round 15.
- **No task shares a round with one of its dependencies.** The one exception is T01, whose `sites.py` edits land after T00 merges within round 1.
- **With three agents**, T41 moves to lane C in round 8 and T42 to round 9, T24 runs after T23b, and T63/T64/T61 slip to rounds 9–11. The critical path grows by about 2 rounds.
- **Early signals:**
  - the contract test (round 2);
  - the T30 template gate (round 5);
  - the T23b URL gate (round 7);
  - the walking skeleton (round 7).
- **Largest schedule risks:**
  - T34, the content engine. Assign the best-prepared agent, and write R's shortcode suites ahead of time.
  - The markup decision, settled early by T04.

## 9. Risks and mitigations

| # | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Late end-to-end signal; semantic drift found late | high | Oracle-fixture gates in every crate; structure-oracle gates in T23b and T30; walking skeleton in round 7; contract test from round 2 |
| 2 | Re-deriving Hugo semantics loses subtle rules | high | Salvage rule by rule from `go-parity-final`, each with the fixture that covers it; specs in `docs/rust-port/specs`; reviewed `expected_diffs.toml` |
| 3 | Tera 2 strictness (undefined values, keyword-only arguments, literal includes, hygienic components, no return values) and a young engine | high | <ul><li>views emit every key</li><li>the `or`/`?.` idioms</li><li>explicit `__nh` scope plus `page=`</li><li>`partial`/`return_value` frames</li><li>all names registered before load</li><li>`templates check` lints</li><li>pin `=2.4.0`; fix upstream (MIT)</li><li>minijinja is the documented escape hatch (costs a re-conversion)</li></ul> |
| 4 | Plain-data views: memory, depth, cross-page access | medium | Summary lists + `deref`; lazy full values; `page_content` functions with a precise error; dhat measurement in T33 |
| 5 | Concurrency: cycles, deadlocks, duplicated side effects | high | <ul><li>never-blocking memo cells</li><li>chain-based cycle detection in the scope</li><li>fragments as a separate stage</li><li>buffered store writes committed by the winner</li><li>no DashMap guard held while rendering</li><li>no parallel work inside renders</li><li>forced two-thread tests</li></ul> |
| 6 | comrak cannot handle tight deflists, `\[..\]` math, block attributes, alert titles or accurate inline positions | medium | T04 spike before the API freeze; engine-neutral `markup` API; pulldown-cmark plus custom passes as the fallback |
| 7 | Highlighting differs from Chroma; no `go-html-template` grammar; no `guessSyntax` | medium (visual) | Scope → Chroma class map with a coverage test; own Go-template syntax or an HTML alias; differences allowed at L3 |
| 8 | Publish-on-reference misses a resource or publishes too much | medium | Tokens decoded from HTML and JSON escapes; execute_as_template outputs scanned; rescan after `patch_held`; `publish` filter; L1 catches both directions |
| 9 | Pagination semantics | medium | Keyed recorder with conflict errors; `nh-page/pagination` oracle; A-R includes 404 paging and the conditional paginator |
| 10 | Disk: shared target, registry, node_modules, worktrees | high | §8.1 budget; `disk.sh` guards both target size and free space; heavy crates isolated; `[lib] test = false` on the heavy-graph crates; Go caches cleaned; release builds only in T70; `KEEP=1` opt-in |
| 11 | Cargo build-lock contention between four agents on 4 CPUs | medium | Lane D is mostly Tera; heavy crates stay out of lanes A/B until round 8; short `-p` test cycles |
| 12 | Crates needing a rustc newer than 1.94.1 | medium | `resolver = "3"` MSRV-aware resolution; `cargo update --precise` pins recorded |
| 13 | grass stale since 2024 | low for the targets | Reconstruction SCSS tested in T42; optional `dartsass` subprocess |
| 14 | Unverified crate details (tera-contrib features, comrak `attributes`, two-face, ureq TLS, qrcode, unicode-properties, base64 major) | low | T00 verifies and pins with network access; fallbacks named in §5 |
| 15 | Licence contamination | high (legal) | Clean room; SPDX-evaluated `deny.toml`; `PROVENANCE.md`; T70 audit |
| 16 | The ratchet quietly accepts regressions | medium | Required triage classes; self-test; hard invariants (link integrity, heading IDs, alias/RSS/sitemap sets, structure oracle); baseline review each phase |
| 17 | Hand-converted layouts diverge from the Go originals | medium | Per-page L2/L3 against Go; worst-20 review; conversion rules and lints; docs patch variants mirror Go 1:1 |
| 18 | Salvage turns into transliteration | medium | Legacy removed from the tree; `git show` only for rules; §1.2 checklist; clippy at phase end; filters built on ecosystem ops |
| 19 | Semantic drift from dependencies (YAML 1.2 vs 1.1, CLDR, ICU dates) | low | 218-front-matter corpus; locales oracle; collation and plural allowlists |
| 20 | External tools and network (esbuild, node, Tailwind, GetRemote) | medium | Pinned esbuild build script; node.sh lockfile; offline GetRemote cache with key importer; both builds run with HTTP disabled; clear errors naming missing binaries |
| 21 | Private seeksnack repo unavailable | medium | A-R is the blocking gate; A-S runs when the repo is attached (D6) |
| 22 | Scope creep toward all of Hugo | medium | MUST/SHOULD/COULD from the feature inventory drive the task list; COULD only in T72 |

| Tera: testsite / reconstruction / docs / real seeksnack | ~100 / ~900 / ~3,600 / ~900 | – | template lines |

**Throughput.** About 40 tasks of 0.4–4.8k lines across four lanes, in about 13 rounds to A-D1, 14 to A-D2, then the COULD tail. The main uncertainty is the parity rounds (T60, T62, T65); budget one to two extra rounds of fix tasks for them.

## 11. Decisions for the user

The plan proceeds with the stated default unless you say otherwise.

- **D1. Highlighting engine.** **Default:** syntect + two-face (MIT, emits Chroma class names, so the docs CSS keeps working). **Alternative:** giallo, which is EUPL-1.2 and cannot emit Chroma classes.
- **D2. Zola code reuse.**
  - (a) Clean room: ideas only.
  - **(b) Default:** additionally copy single MIT files from Zola before commit 3c9131db for low-risk infrastructure (serve/livereload/watch classification, fs copy-if-changed, image-queue shape), with `PROVENANCE.md` entries. This needs network access.
  - Code from Zola ≥ 0.22 is never copied.
- **D3. Delete the old port in T00.** It stays recoverable through the `go-parity-final` tag. **Default:** yes.
- **D4. Tera-only templates.** neohugo stops accepting Go-template layouts, legacy layout names, and Go-template assets used with `execute_as_template`. Existing Hugo sites convert them (the migrate tool, T73, is optional). Content shortcode syntax and i18n `{{ .Field }}` placeholders stay Hugo's. **Default:** yes.
- **D5. Accepted deviations from Hugo** (documented in `template-api.md`):
  - content is rendered before layouts, so another page's content inside a shortcode goes through `page_content`;
  - pagination is explicit, and a conflicting second `paginate` is an error (Hugo silently ignores it);
  - lazily published resources are published on reference (URL tokens);
  - no `#ZgotmplZ` sanitising;
  - YAML 1.2 in untyped params (`yes` stays a string);
  - deterministic winners for URL collisions;
  - newer CLDR collation;
  - `$_hugo_config` v1 shortcode semantics are dropped;
  - prefix lookup is segment-aware;
  - target-path assets: the earlier language wins, and conflicting inputs within one language are an error;
  - site-bound functions inside components need `page=` or `@__nh`;
  - `hugo.version` reports `0.149.0-DEV`.

  **Default:** accept.
- **D6. Real seeksnack.** Attach the private repository for gate A-S and T73, or accept the reconstruction (A-R) as the final seeksnack gate. **Default:** A-R blocks; A-S runs when the repository is available.
- **D7. Scope beyond the three sites.** Whether `server` (T71) and the COULD features (T72) belong in this effort. **Default:** after A-D2, in the listed order; T71 may run in spare lane capacity from round 11.
- **D8. Network access.** Network is needed in T00 (`cargo fetch`) and T01 (`npm ci` for node tooling, GOPROXY for the Go oracle). **Default:** yes; everything afterwards runs offline.

## 12. Review notes

These are the review points that were rejected or only partly applied, one line each. Every other blocker, major and minor point from the three reviews was applied as written.

- **Thread-local `RenderFrame` stack** (completeness, feasibility): replaced by the explicit `__nh` scope value (Rust-style review). It covers the same cases (partial, shortcode, hook, defer, wave-2 pager) and stays sound under work-stealing.
- **Fixpoint rescan of published CSS/JS** (feasibility): rejected. Hugo publishes only through template calls, so we scan template outputs, `execute_as_template` results included, and nothing else.
- **Legacy layout-name aliases in the loader** (completeness, feasibility option): rejected. Overlays use v0.146 names, and the legacy mapping lives only in the oracle normaliser and `migrate`.
- **Keeping `{# hugo:v1 #}` inner semantics** (original draft): dropped per the Rust-style review. R's `v1.html` is an L3 `accepted-deviation` and does not affect the file set.
- **"A failed GetRemote returns `{err}` and is never a build error"** (completeness): rejected. Errors propagate unless `optional=true`; the converted docs templates use `optional=true`, and both builds run offline.
- **Chroma style → theme map for the full style gallery** (completeness, option 1): deferred to T72, and the gallery page stays patched in A-D2. `noClasses`, `hl_inline` and `lineNumbersInTable` were accepted into T25.
- **`resolver.feature-unification = "workspace"`** (feasibility, alternative): the hand-written workspace-hack was chosen, because the option is not known to be stable in cargo 1.94.1. T00 verifies, and we switch if it is stable.
- **Session typestate** (Rust-style, alternative): `OnceLock`-frozen generations were chosen instead. A typestate would make `sitefuncs` generic over two session types for no behavioural gain.
- **Scheduling T35 before T34** (feasibility, option 1): rejected. T34 builds against T33's frozen `sitefuncs::register` stub, and the docs cross-page cases move to T36, so both tasks share round 9 and the path stays 13 rounds.
- **Adopting an inflection/title crate wholesale** (ecosystem dossier): applied only as an evaluation step in T10. Own data tables are written if no crate reaches 100% on the flect/prose oracle, because `<title>` parity depends on it.
- **Removing `version_compare` in favour of a semver test** (Rust-style): applied. The `-DEV` ranking rule is checked against the docs `new-in` pages rather than assumed.

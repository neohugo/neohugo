description: List npm packages in package.json; fugo installs them when it builds and runs Tailwind and Babel itself, without Node.js or npm.

Put the npm packages a site needs in `package.json`, next to the configuration file:

```json {title="package.json"}
{
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": { "alpinejs": "^3.14.9" },
  "devDependencies": {
    "tailwindcss": "^4.1.0",
    "@tailwindcss/cli": "^4.1.0",
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.16"
  }
}
```

`fugo build` and `fugo server` install them into `node_modules` before they read the project.
You do not need Node.js or npm:

- [`js_build`](/asset-pipelines/js-build/) bundles what you import from them;
- [mounts](/configuration/module/) can use their files (`node_modules/bootstrap/scss`);
- [`tailwind`](/asset-pipelines/tailwind-css/) and [`babel`](/asset-pipelines/babel/) run the
  `@tailwindcss/cli` and `@babel/cli` packages with the JavaScript runtime built into fugo.
  It loads native addons, such as Tailwind's.

The next build installs nothing until `package.json` or the lock file changes. `fugo server`
installs again when you save `package.json`.

## What gets installed

fugo installs `dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `optionalDependencies`, the way npm lays them
out: one `node_modules` with every package hoisted as far up as its version allows, and each
program in `node_modules/.bin`. It installs only the optional packages for your platform, such
as Tailwind's native addon for your operating system and processor.

Packages come from the npm registry, or from the registry and credentials in the project's
`.npmrc` or your `~/.npmrc`. Each download is checked against its integrity hash. Downloads are
kept in `:cacheDir/packages` (see [Caching](/configuration/caching/)), so a second project with
the same packages installs without the network.

Install scripts (`preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`) never run.

## The lock file

fugo writes the versions it installed to `npm.lock`, next to `package.json`. The file is in
Deno's lockfile format, because fugo's installer is Deno's. Commit it: a fresh checkout installs
the same versions. When `npm.lock` does not exist, fugo starts from the versions in
`package-lock.json`, if you have one.

To upgrade, change the range in `package.json`, or delete `npm.lock`.

## Using npm, pnpm or yarn instead

fugo manages a `node_modules` it created itself, or one that does not exist yet. It leaves
`node_modules` alone if:

- npm, pnpm or yarn wrote it (their state files are inside);
- it is a link;
- it is not empty and fugo did not create it.

If you install with your own package manager, fugo uses what you installed. Delete
`node_modules` to let fugo install it again.

## Finding the tools

fugo runs the `@tailwindcss/cli` and `@babel/cli` packages from the project's `node_modules`
with its own JavaScript runtime. To use another version of a tool, change it in `package.json`.
fugo does not use `tailwindcss` or `babel` programs on your `PATH`.

A fugo built without the `npm` feature (`cargo build --no-default-features --features
goat,math`) has no installer and no runtime. It runs the tools from `node_modules/.bin` instead,
so you need Node.js and an installed `node_modules`.

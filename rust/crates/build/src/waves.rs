//! Phases E2 and E3: the render waves (REWRITE_PLAN.md §3.3).
//!
//! A wave's jobs come from the session (`Session::wave1` per language, `Session::wave2`).
//! Before anything renders, every job's target is known (`Session::target`) and collisions
//! are resolved: a page (or pager) beats an alias, and among jobs of the same class the later
//! [`JobOrder`] wins. A job whose target an earlier wave already claimed is compared with that
//! file's job the same way (the language sub-waves run in language order, so among equals a
//! later language wins). Each collision is reported as a warning and in
//! [`BuildReport::collisions`].
//!
//! Losing jobs are still rendered, but their outputs are dropped: rendering is pure except for
//! what it records (the first `paginator()` call, `defer` keys), and Go renders every page,
//! so a losing list page still gets its pagers (seeksnack's colliding term directories, a page
//! whose `url` is `/`), which then compete for their own targets in wave 2.
//!
//! The jobs render on the render pool; each winning output goes straight to
//! `Publisher::emit` from its worker (the publisher's stats and URL tokens are sorted sets,
//! and no two published outputs share a path). Errors are reported in job order.

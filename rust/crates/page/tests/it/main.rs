//! Integration tests of `neohugo-page` (the crate's single test binary, REWRITE_PLAN.md §2.2).
//!
//! The oracle tests replay the Go fixtures under `rust/testdata/oracle/page/` that concern
//! single pages (target paths, permalinks, dates, cascade, markup, build options, the default
//! sort order) and print their pass rates; menus, pagination and related content are
//! `neohugo-nav`'s.
